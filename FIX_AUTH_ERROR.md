# ðŸ”§ Fix "The requested action is invalid" Error

## The Problem
Firebase is blocking the authentication because `localhost:8080` isn't in the authorized domains list.

## Quick Fix - Add Authorized Domains

### 1. Go to Firebase Console
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/rovi-16b3a/authentication/settings

### 2. In the "Authorized domains" section, add:
- `localhost`
- `127.0.0.1`

Click "Add domain" for each one.

### 3. Save the changes

### 4. Try again
Refresh the dashboard and try signing in again.

Instead of localhost, we can use the Firebase app URL directly:

1. Change the URL in your browser from:
   `http://localhost:8080/dashboard-authenticated.html`
   
   To:
   `https://rovi-16b3a.firebaseapp.com/dashboard-authenticated.html`

2. But first, we need to deploy the dashboard files to Firebase Hosting.

## Or Use Direct Firebase Auth (No Redirect)

I'll create a version that doesn't need domain authorization:
